# PawDetect
PawDetect is a simple dog breed classifier that uses transfer learning to train the model on top of the resnet18 model. It uses fast.ai to scrape the web for the 40 most popular dog breeds as well as build the model efficiently with an accuracy of 87%.
Gradio and HuggingFace Spaces were used to build and deploy the application.
